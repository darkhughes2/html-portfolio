<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movies<br /> the acting of all the cast its supperb<br /> and the themes of freedom and devotion<br /> it just resonates with me<br /> also the music from Hanz Zimmer it gorgeous</p>
<h3>Redline</h3>
<p>This is my favorite animated film,<br /> its kind of dumb but the animation its a blend of <br />3D generated and hand drawn art that always manage<br /> to take your breath away</p>
<h3>Nick and Nor's Infinite Playlist</h3>
<p>A rom com that I love thanks to the music<br /> indie rock and a cheesy rock adventure in new york</p>
